    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 green bell peppers</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the tops off bell peppers and remove the seeds. Cook bell peppers in
        boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each bell
        pepper and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
        and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat
        and season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, rice,
        and Worcestershire sauce; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until
        rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stuff each bell pepper with beef and rice mixture; arrange open-side up
        in a baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and
        bubbly, about 25 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
